# Data Design Document
## Paperless-ngx ML Platform — Data Team

**Team:** Dongting Gao (Training), Yikai Sun (Serving), Elnath Zhao (Data)  
**Version:** 1.0

---

## 1. Overview

This document describes the data architecture for the Paperless-ngx ML platform. The system extends a document management service with two ML features: handwriting text recognition (HTR) at upload time, and semantic search at query time. The data platform must support real-time inference on incoming documents and queries, and periodic retraining from accumulated user feedback.

---

## 2. Data Repositories

### 2.1 PostgreSQL — Application State

**Purpose:** Source of truth for document metadata, user feedback, and training event logs.

**Written by:** Paperless-ngx application on every upload, correction, and search interaction.  
**Updated:** Continuously during service operation.  
**Versioning:** Not versioned directly — serves as the transactional record from which Iceberg snapshots are derived.

#### Tables

**`documents`**
```
id              UUID        PRIMARY KEY
filename        TEXT        NOT NULL
uploaded_at     TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
source          VARCHAR(16) CHECK (source IN ('user_upload', 'synthetic', 'test'))
page_count      INTEGER
tesseract_text  TEXT
htr_text        TEXT
merged_text     TEXT
is_test_doc     BOOLEAN     DEFAULT FALSE
deleted_at      TIMESTAMPTZ
```
Stores one row per uploaded document. `merged_text` is the concatenation of Tesseract OCR output and HTR output, and is the text encoded into the vector index. `source` distinguishes real uploads from synthetic traffic generator uploads and test documents.

**`document_pages`**
```
id              UUID        PRIMARY KEY
document_id     UUID        REFERENCES documents(id)
page_number     INTEGER
image_s3_url    TEXT        NOT NULL
tesseract_text  TEXT
htr_text        TEXT
htr_confidence  FLOAT
htr_flagged     BOOLEAN     DEFAULT FALSE
created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
```
One row per page. `image_s3_url` points to the page image in MinIO. `htr_flagged` is set when confidence falls below the threshold, triggering the user review UI.

**`handwritten_regions`**
```
id              UUID        PRIMARY KEY
page_id         UUID        REFERENCES document_pages(id)
crop_s3_url     TEXT        NOT NULL
htr_output      TEXT
htr_confidence  FLOAT
created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
```
One row per detected handwritten region within a page. `crop_s3_url` points to the cropped region image in MinIO. This is the granular unit fed to the HTR model.

**`htr_corrections`**
```
id              UUID        PRIMARY KEY
region_id       UUID        REFERENCES handwritten_regions(id)
user_id         UUID
original_text   TEXT
corrected_text  TEXT        NOT NULL
corrected_at    TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
opted_in        BOOLEAN     DEFAULT TRUE
excluded_from_training BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
```
Written when a user edits an HTR transcription. `opted_in` respects the user's data contribution preference. `excluded_from_training` is set by the batch pipeline for duplicates or policy-excluded records.

**`query_sessions`**
```
id              UUID        PRIMARY KEY
query_text      TEXT        NOT NULL
queried_at      TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
user_id         UUID
is_test_account BOOLEAN     DEFAULT FALSE
result_doc_ids  UUID[]
```
One row per search query. `result_doc_ids` captures the ranked list of documents returned, needed to identify shown-but-not-clicked negatives.

**`search_feedback`**
```
id              UUID        PRIMARY KEY
session_id      UUID        REFERENCES query_sessions(id)
document_id     UUID        REFERENCES documents(id)
feedback_type   VARCHAR(16) CHECK (feedback_type IN ('click', 'thumbs_up', 'thumbs_down'))
created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
```
Written on user interaction with search results. `click` is an implicit positive signal; `thumbs_up` / `thumbs_down` are explicit. Only explicit feedback is used for retrieval retraining (see Section 5).

---

### 2.2 MinIO — Object Storage

**Purpose:** Durable storage for raw images, cropped regions, ingested external datasets, and Iceberg table data.  
**Written by:** Paperless-ngx upload handler (page images), HTR preprocessing service (crops), ingestion pipeline (external datasets), Airflow DAGs (Iceberg Parquet files).  
**Versioning:** Iceberg manages versioning within `paperless-datalake`. Raw image buckets are append-only; files are never overwritten.

#### Buckets

**`paperless-images`**
```
documents/{document_id}/page_{n}.png         Raw full-page scan images
documents/{document_id}/regions/{region_id}.png  Cropped handwritten region images
```
All uploaded document images. Written once at upload time, never modified. Soft-deleted documents retain their images until a cleanup job runs.

**`paperless-datalake`**
```
warehouse/
  iam_dataset/
    train/    Parquet files — IAM line images (base64) + ground-truth text
    val/
    test/
  squad_dataset/
    train/    Parquet files — (question, passage, label) triplets
    val/
  htr_training/
    data/     Parquet files — versioned HTR fine-tuning pairs
    metadata/ Iceberg metadata and manifests
  retrieval_training/
    data/     Parquet files — versioned retrieval triplets
    metadata/ Iceberg metadata and manifests
```

**`paperless-staging`**
```
iam_raw/      Downloaded IAM archive before processing
squad_raw/    Downloaded SQuAD JSON before processing
augmented/    Augmented HTR images produced by ingestion pipeline
```
Temporary staging area for ETL jobs. Cleared after successful ingestion.

---

### 2.3 Qdrant — Vector Index

**Purpose:** Stores dense embeddings for all document chunks, enabling approximate nearest-neighbor search at query time.  
**Written by:** Document indexing service, triggered after each upload's `merged_text` is finalized.  
**Updated:** On new upload, on HTR correction (re-encode updated merged_text), on document deletion (soft-delete payload flag).  
**Versioning:** Not snapshot-versioned. Qdrant is the online serving index only — the training data is versioned separately in Iceberg.

#### Collections

**`document_chunks`**
```
id:         UUID  (chunk-level, derived from document_id + chunk_index)
vector:     float[768]   Dense embedding from bi-encoder
payload:
  document_id:   UUID
  chunk_index:   INTEGER
  chunk_text:    TEXT
  uploaded_at:   TIMESTAMPTZ
  is_deleted:    BOOLEAN
```
Each document is split into fixed-size overlapping text chunks (e.g., 256 tokens, 32-token stride). Each chunk is encoded independently and stored as one point. At query time, the query vector is matched against all non-deleted chunk vectors using HNSW approximate nearest-neighbor search; top-k chunks are returned and deduplicated to document level.

---

### 2.4 Redpanda — Event Stream

**Purpose:** Decouples the upload API from downstream processing. Carries upload events, correction events, and search feedback events so that inference services and batch pipelines can consume them independently without adding load to PostgreSQL.  
**Written by:** API service on every upload, correction submission, and search feedback action.  
**Versioning:** Not versioned directly. Redpanda retains events by offset; the batch Airflow DAG tracks a watermark (Kafka offset checkpoint) to consume incrementally.

#### Topics

| Topic | Event schema | Consumers |
|---|---|---|
| `paperless.uploads` | `{document_id, page_count, uploaded_at, source}` | HTR preprocessing service, document indexing service |
| `paperless.corrections` | `{region_id, document_id, corrected_text, corrected_at, opted_in}` | Re-indexing service, Airflow HTR DAG |
| `paperless.queries` | `{session_id, query_text, queried_at, result_doc_ids}` | Airflow retrieval DAG |
| `paperless.feedback` | `{session_id, document_id, feedback_type, created_at}` | Airflow retrieval DAG |

---

### 2.5 Iceberg Tables — Versioned Training Data

**Purpose:** Durable, versioned training and evaluation datasets consumed by the training team. Every write creates a new snapshot with a stable `snapshot_id` that can be recorded alongside model artifacts for full reproducibility.  
**Written by:** Airflow DAGs (batch pipeline).  
**Catalog backend:** PostgreSQL (`iceberg_catalog` database).  
**Storage backend:** MinIO (`paperless-datalake/warehouse/`).

                  6. Write → Iceberg retrieval_training.triplets
                     (new snapshot)
```

---

## 4. Versioning and Lineage

Every Iceberg table write produces a new snapshot. Before each training run, the training service records:

```json
{
  "model": "htr_v2",
  "iceberg_table": "htr_training.fine_tune_pairs",
  "snapshot_id": 8473920174,
  "trained_at": "2025-04-01T14:00:00Z"
}
```

This `snapshot_id` is stored with the model artifact, enabling exact reproduction of the training dataset for any past model version by pointing PyIceberg at that specific snapshot.

For the IAM and SQuAD external datasets, lineage is recorded in the Iceberg table `source` column and in a separate `dataset_registry` PostgreSQL table:

```
dataset_registry
  name          TEXT    'iam' | 'squad_2.0'
  version       TEXT
  download_url  TEXT
  downloaded_at TIMESTAMPTZ
  record_count  INTEGER
  s3_path       TEXT
  license       TEXT
```

---

## 5. Candidate Selection and Leakage Prevention

### HTR training pairs
- **Include:** Only `htr_corrections` rows where `corrected_text != ''` and `opted_in = true` (user actively typed a correction, not just dismissed the flag)
- **Exclude:** Test/synthetic documents (`source != 'user_upload'`), duplicate region scans (same `writer_id` + identical `corrected_text` within 7 days), documents where `deleted_at` is set
- **Split:** Time-based — train on corrections older than 14 days, validate on the most recent 14 days. This prevents the model from training on styles it will be evaluated on.
- **Leakage prevention:** Training inputs are always raw crop images, never the model's own prior HTR output. Preprocessing (normalization, augmentation parameters) is fitted on the training split only.

### Retrieval training triplets
- **Include:** Only sessions with explicit feedback (`thumbs_up` or `thumbs_down`) or confirmed clicks; exclude sessions from test accounts (`is_test_account = true`)
- **Exclude:** Sessions where the user issued the same query within 5 minutes (likely a reformulation, not independent signal), documents with `deleted_at` set at training time
- **Split:** Time-based — train on sessions older than 7 days, validate on the most recent 7 days
- **Leakage prevention:** `pos_chunk_text` and `neg_chunk_text` are snapshotted from PostgreSQL at `query_date`, not from current document state. This ensures the training example reflects what the model would have seen at inference time, not a later-edited version of the document.
