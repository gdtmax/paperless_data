"""
IAM handwriting crop pool.

Loads a sample of real handwritten line images from MinIO (the IAM
dataset shards ingested earlier into s3://paperless-datalake/
iam_dataset/train/shard_*.parquet) into memory so the data generator
can paste REAL handwriting into synthetic document pages.

Why this matters:
  The previous generator drew a blue squiggly line to trigger region
  detection. The slicer found the ink, but TrOCR produced gibberish
  because there were no letterforms to transcribe. behavior_emulator
  had nothing to correct toward — all corrections ended up as no-ops.

  Real IAM crops have real letter shapes, so TrOCR produces plausible
  transcriptions (often correct, sometimes with character errors).
  Corrections perturbing those outputs produce real training signal.

Memory footprint: a 500-crop pool is ~25-50MB (most crops are ~30-60KB
grayscale PNGs). We keep them as bytes; each gets PIL-decoded on demand
inside the page compositor.
